"y" is perÂ­capita real disposable income,

Refresher on instruments, out good friend for demand estimation! 

1) Validity: cov(u,Z) = 0.

in demand estimation u are all the unobservable factors that affect the demand ... 
"demand-shifters", "taste", ...

2) Relvance: cov(X,Z) not 0.

instrument should affect the endogenuous variable 

3) Exclusion: Z has no direct link with Y.

Simply the fact that instrument should be "excluded exogenuous variable"
